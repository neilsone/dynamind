# Linkage Matrix Overview

System/Area Relationships:
- TODO: Describe the purpose of this matrix (e.g., dependencies, data flows, logical or physical grouping).

| Source Service/Area | Relationship Type | Target Service/Area | Notes/Links |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| TODO                | TODO             | TODO                | TODO        |

Instructions:
- Extend this table with all relevant cross-service or cross-area relationships.
- Use "Relationship Type" for dependency, data flow, co-location, grouping, etc.
- Add more columns as needed for architectural, regional, or compliance overviews.
- Mark incomplete or uncertain relationships with a TODO for later clarification.

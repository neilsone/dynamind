# Service Context & Registry Guide

## 🏢 Audience & Context

**Audience:** System Service Architects, Engineering Teams, Technical Owners  
**Purpose:** Ensure every service centrally documents delivery, architecture, compliance, and knowledge as part of a larger system. Aligns with system/platform patterns and organizational standards.

## 📚 What This File Does

Use this template to provide the primary navigation and service registration guide for any independent deployable or microservice. OVERVIEW.md (and optional additional context files) should provide metadata and cross-links; all source, onboarding, and configuration remain in the canonical repository.

## 📖 Service Registration Structure

Located in: `service-areas/{{SERVICE_AREA}}/services/{{SERVICE_NAME}}/`

This directory contains OVERVIEW.md as the only centrally managed knowledge doc. Related architectural or compliance docs may be included as needed, but all config and deep onboarding must live in the canonical repo.

## 🗺️ Cross-Navigation: Platform Knowledge

- System/platform patterns & onboarding: `../../../platform/`
- System-wide service directory: `../../../memory-bank/project-index.md`

## 🔑 Compliance, Reuse & Contribution

- For all design/delivery gates, reflect architectural decisions in `systemPatterns.md` and reference platform/area patterns.
- Suggest new area or platform patterns by raising proposals via appropriate `systemPatterns.md` files and contributing through platform workflows.
- Keep compliance milestones up to date in `progress.md`—especially security, audit, and lifecycle checkpoints.

## ➕ Service Best Practices

1. **Keep service registry docs and contacts up to date in OVERVIEW.md.**
2. **Ensure OVERVIEW.md links to the correct canonical source repo for configs, code, and all team onboarding.**
3. **Cross-link to central system patterns and platform knowledge for guidance, never duplicate deep onboarding locally.**
4. **Maintain all service onboarding and compliance in the canonical repository, not in this central registry—except for system-wide context docs as needed.**

**This directory is strictly for system-level registry/context. All implementation, onboarding, and deep service documentation remains in the canonical service repository.**

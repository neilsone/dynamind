# Service Area Registry & Context Guide

## 🏢 Audience & Context

**Audience:** Domain Group Leads, Architects, and Area Stakeholders  
**Purpose:** Document, govern, and evolve service area knowledge within a large software system’s centralized context.

## 📚 What This File Does

This guide orients architects and area leads within a service area context. It explains registry structure, guides linkage to system-wide patterns and onboarding, and supports organizational context for any domain/area grouping.

## 📖 Service Area Registry Structure

Located in: `service-areas/{{SERVICE_AREA}}/`

This directory is a registry for all services in the area. Each `services/[service]/` must include at least OVERVIEW.md but may have any additional area-contextual docs for domain guidance.

## 🗺️ Navigating to Platform and Services

- Platform standards and reusable patterns: `../../../platform/`
- Registry of all service areas/services: `../../../memory-bank/project-index.md`

## 🔑 Governance & Context Patterns

- Align all domain/service documentation to system patterns (`platform/patterns.md`)
- Maintain OVERVIEW.md (plus any area guidance as needed) in the area registry (onboarding and status is managed centrally at the system level)
- For onboarding and cross-area guidance, link always to the platform (system) memory bank.

## ➕ Best Practices

1. Integrate with system standards at every architectural review.
2. Foster reuse by ensuring services and areas cross-link to key patterns, canonical repos, and system registry.
3. Always reference only OVERVIEW.md and area-wide guides in this registry.

**This template is for service area registries in any large system/platform. Do not author memory banks here; all onboarding and organizational knowledge live in the platform/system memory bank.**

# Dynamind Knowledge Integration Guide

## 🏢 Audience & Context

**Audience:** Chief stakeholders and consumers of the dynamind content.    
**Purpose:** Provide a single source of truth for cross-domain standards, paved paths, reusable patterns, and governance for any large system.

## 📚 What This File Does

This navigation guide orients dynamind architects and leads within the memory bank context. It describes the recommended reading order, where to find and contribute dynamind patterns, how to align focus areas, and how to participate in system-wide knowledge management.

## ️ Navigating Focus Areas & Focuses

- Focus area registries are under `focus-areas/[focus]/`
- Focus OVERVIEW.md files and cross-linking metadata are under `focus-areas/[focus]/`
- Focus sections allow for additional focus specific organization. 
- Focus sections are under `focus-areas/[focus]/focus-sections/[section]/OVERVIEW.md`
- See `memory-bank/focus-index.md` for the authoritative dynamind focus/focus area index

## 🔒 Governance & Contribution Guidance

- **Dynamind patterns:** Contribute only proven, reusable solutions applicable across multiple domains or focus areas.
- **Reviews:** Use `workflows.md` for architectural review, pattern acceptance, and dynamind governance.
- **Dynamind context:** Update `dynamindContext.md` as system vision evolves.
- **Onboarding:** Link new teams or contributors to this guide as their entry point.

## ➕ Best Practices

- Reference dynamind patterns early in every new focus/focus area initiative.
- Use `resources.md` to standardize tool usage and avoid fragmentation.
- Document and suggest new workflows in `workflows.md`.
- Regularly review platform architecture documentation to ensure service alignment.

### Documentation (Memory Bank) Update Triggers

- Memory Bank updates are required when:
    1. Discovering new project patterns
    2. After implementing significant changes
    3. When a user requests with **update memory bank** – at which time ALL memory bank files MUST be reviewed (not just those requiring change)
    4. When context needs clarification

### Update Process

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]

    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]

        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end

    Start --> Process
```

**Notes:**
- When triggered by **update memory bank**, or **update dynamind** the full review must always include dynamindContext.md and dynamindProgress.md, as they are critical to tracking the current state.
- After every memory reset, the dynamind is my only link to previous work. Its precision and clarity are critical; all effectiveness depends on its accuracy.

**This CLINE.md.template is designed for a large-scale memory bank. All documentation, navigation, and contribution processes here are expected to be maintained by dynamind stakeholders. Each focus/area in the registry is represented by OVERVIEW.md and points here for all organizational-wide context.**
